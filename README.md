# EatingMonsersGame
The following were the step by step process of how this small 2d game came together:

1. Download the bird package from this website: https://game.courses/birds/

2. The aim of this project is to use this package features and try to modify them/add some features by using the appropriate codes according to the lecture of the IntroToUnity along with Jason Weimann 'Unity Game Development for Beginners' video/ courses guidlance. In short we start with builiding up our Assets , setting background and the coding with the initial features like making the bird flying or preventing them to fall and so on.

3. The short description of the game is as follow- the player is a bird who in order to progress to anotehr level have to kill all the monster in given level.

4. We start with defining the environment and some initial functions for player such as using the mouse by clicking Up and Down as well as Dragging to change the color and position of the player.

5. Creating a 2D Character with a SpriteRenderer, Physics with Rigidbody2D, Collisions, PolygonCollider2D, BoxCollider2D for the bird and the background.

6. Backgrounds, Sprite Tiling, SortingLayers, OrderInLayer

7. After creating the bird asset and assigning the features we move to create anotehr asset - monster.

8. We look at different ways that enemy ( a monster ) could die – for example from box collision.

9. Creating simple particle on our monster

10. Building up another level – when we kill all the monster we progress to another level

11. After creating level 2 we need to write some code to progress from one level to another – we are going to create level progression control – simple script that keeps track of how many monsters are alive in our level and progresses to another level once all of the monsters are death. To do that we going to create another code script.

12.In order for level change to work we need to go to file on unity and Build settings to change the default scenes we like.

13. Working on camera setting , using prefab. From package manager installing Cinemachine.
